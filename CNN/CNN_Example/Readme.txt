This invention opens a parallel computing paradigm.

This requires to run in Simulink/MatLab.
Please do not change the name of components in the Simulink named Cellmodel.mdl. Any change should be after you get understood
After understood what are in these examples, please change the values of initial conditions, inputs...as shown in the orginal paper 


All the values of parameters are in .m file, you can change according to those given in the original papers,


The outputs in numbers are in the command window of MatLab, the plot also shows the results,
Two examples are simple and are realized with parameters given in the paper by Chua-Yang. Please refer the original paper for more details.

Any further information on this simulation, please don't hesitate to contact me at hmthang01@yahoo.com or hmt@mail.hut.edu.vn
