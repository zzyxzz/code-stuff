This folder contains the "Additional Material" mentioned in paper:

Camunas-Mesa L, Zamarreno-Ramos C, Perez-Carrasco JA, Masquelier T,Serrano-Gotarredona T, and Linares-Barranco B. On Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity, Memristive Devices, and building a Self-Learning Visual Cortex. Frontiers in Neuromorphic Engineering, inaugural issue article.


It contains a total of 9 folders. Each corresponds to a particular simulation and usually finishes by generating one of the figures in the paper. Simulations are either in Matlab, C or Spectre (with additional matlab pre or post processing). For the Spectre simulations, we include only the netlist file together with instructions on how
to run it. We strongly recommend you draw the schematics using a schematic capture tool (like Composer in Cadence).
